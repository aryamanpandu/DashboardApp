<h3>Dashboard App</h3>

<p>This is a Dashboard App that I had created during my co-op at immediac.
  It is an app that takes anonymous surveys to gauge employee mental health and performance.
I created the backend and api endpoints in .NET while the frontend is fully in swift using swiftUI.
It has the basic functionality of showing surveys, adding surveys, editing surveys, and removing surveys</p>

<p>This app has the functionality of adding surveys and also graphing them individually and their average.</p>

<p>It asks you four basic questions:
  <ul>
    <li>How Happy are you?</li>
    <li>How stressed are you?</li>
    <li>Do you understand the objective?</li>
    <li>How much fun are you having?</li>
  </ul></p>
<p>These questions can be answered from a range of 0-10</p>
